# SuperGenPass extension for Firefox

[SuperGenPass](https://github.com/chriszarate/supergenpass/wiki/FAQ) is a useful hash-based
password generator, creating unique passwords based on a master password and site's domain,
without needing to sync your passwords to a server.

This extension implements password generation using the same hashing algorithm. MD5 passwords
generated with the SuperGenPass bookmarklet and the mobile version will be the same as the
passwords generated by this extension, as long as the master password used is the same.

The official SuperGenPass bookmarklet and the mobile version support both MD5 and SHA-512 hashes
for generating the passwords. This extension does not support SHA-512 passwords yet.

## Usage

The extension will provide an icon inside the URL bar on all http://, https:// and file:// URLs.
Clicking that URL bar icon will open a popup where you can view the password generated for
the page's domain or copy it to the clipboard.

The extension will prompt you for your master password the first time you try to generate a
password, and once again after every browser restart. The master password will not be stored
permanently by this extension. You can clear the master password by clicking the padlock
icon in the URL bar popup, if you e.g. want to protect your browser from other users, or if you
believe you've entered your master password incorrectly and want to re-enter it, or if you use
multiple master passwords and want to switch between them.

You can set the password length and add a secret password in the extension options page (click the
toolbar button for the options popup â€” not the URL bar icon). These _will_ be saved in your browser
and will persist between sessions.
